### **Public vs. Private IP Address**  

| **Feature**                                       | **Public IP Address**                                                  | **Private IP Address** |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Definition**                              | A globally unique IP address assigned by an ISP (Internet Service Provider)  | A local IP address used within a private network 
                                               to communicate over the internet.                                              (LAN) that is not routable on the internet. |
| **Accessibility**                           | Accessible over the internet.                                                | Only accessible within the private network. |
| **Uniqueness**                              | Unique across the internet.                                                  | Can be reused across different private networks. |
| **Assigned By**                             | Internet providers (AWS, ISPs, etc.).                                        | Network administrators, routers (via DHCP). |
| **Security**                                | More vulnerable; needs firewalls & security measures.                        | More secure as it's isolated from the internet. |
| **Example**                                 | 34.56.78.90 (AWS EC2 instance, website, API)                                 | 192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.1 (home router, internal VPC                                                                                                                                    instances) |

### **Why Does Production Use Public IP Addresses?**
1. **Internet Accessibility**  
   - Applications, APIs, and websites need to be accessible from anywhere.  
   
2. **Global Reachability**  
   - Services like web servers, APIs, and cloud-based apps require a public IP for external users.  

3. **Load Balancing & CDN**  
   - Public IPs enable load balancers and content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute traffic efficiently.  

4. **DNS Mapping**  
   - Public IPs are mapped to domain names for easy access (e.g., `example.com â†’ 52.23.45.67`).  

5. **External Integrations**  
   - Third-party services, APIs, and partners need a public-facing endpoint to interact with your application.

### **When to Use Private IP?**
- Internal communication within a **VPC** (AWS Virtual Private Cloud).  
- Connecting **databases, internal services, or backend applications** securely.  
- For enhanced **security & cost efficiency** (avoiding NAT Gateway charges).
